five key differences between structs and classes:

Classes donâ€™t come with a memberwise initializer; structs get these by default.
Classes can use inheritance to build up functionality; structs cannot.
If you copy a class, both copies point to the same data; copies of structs are always unique.
Classes can have deinitializers; structs cannot.
You can change variable properties inside constant classes; properties inside constant structs are fixed regardless of whether the properties are constants or variables.
