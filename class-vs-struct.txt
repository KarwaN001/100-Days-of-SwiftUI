five key differences between structs and classes:

1- Classes donâ€™t come with a memberwise initializer; structs get these by default.
2- Classes can use inheritance to build up functionality; structs cannot.
3- If you copy a class, both copies point to the same data; copies of structs are always unique.
4- Classes can have deinitializers; structs cannot.
5- You can change variable properties inside constant classes; properties inside constant structs are fixed regardless of whether the properties are constants or variables.
